not a readme but ideas


data exploration:

-pearson coefficent to remove redundant features (or more coefficents)

-remove rows missing features (or use mean or mode)

-decision trees/ random forests to identify important features

-dimensionality reduction (PCA, SVD can also identify important features/ feautures with most variance)

-need to explore many ideas (ridge regression, lasso, random forests, gradient boosting, XGBoost)

-encoding of categorical data

-do exploration on whole data set or representative part of it

-justification of methods

-ensembles with different models?
